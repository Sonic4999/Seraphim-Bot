# postgre_ver Notice
This is an experimental branch in order to see if using PostgreSQL over MySQL will fix any of the problems with the bot. If this fails, then the project is truely dead.

A personal bot made for server I mod in. Meant to be extremely versatile and changable and helping out those servers with tasks otherwise made more difficult with other bots.

Environment vars: MAIN_TOKEN, DB_HOST_URL, DB_PORT, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, LOG_FILE_PATH.
