A personal bot made for features usuaully not seen with other bots, done poorly by other bots, or done by bots with poor uptimes.

Initially started out as a starboard bot, so that's where most of the effort goes to, but the bot does do many other features as well, like a pinboard and sniping.

No setup tutorial because I doubt anyone would even run their own instance. If you do decide you want to, you'll have to look in the code itself to find what you need.

Environment vars: MAIN_TOKEN, DB_URL, DIRECTORY_OF_FILE, LOG_FILE_PATH, TENOR_KEY, JISHAKU_NO_UNDERSCORE=true.
